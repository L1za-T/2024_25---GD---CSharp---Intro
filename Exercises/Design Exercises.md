### Exercise 1: Using an interface (IInteract) to simplify Player mods

**Description**: A player can encounter obstacles/threats/enemies of different types in a game and each threat can modify the player in the following ways:
- lava pit that reduces `health`
- laughing gas that temporarily increases `resistance`
- depress your `mood`

**Note**: I want to be able to easily add/remove/edit threats/obstacles to my game.

**Difficulty:** Medium
