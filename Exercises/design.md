### Exercise 1: Using an interface (IModifyGameObject) to simplify Player mods

**Description**: A player can collect multiple weapons in an inventory. A weapon may affect the target in the following ways:
- Modify a player attribute (e.g., educe health, increase aggression, reduce scale).
- Each weapon has one effect only.
- Each weapon can have multiple effects on a target.
- Each weapon has one random effect on a target.

**Note**: I want to be able to easily add/remove/edit weapon effects to my game.

**Difficulty:** Medium
